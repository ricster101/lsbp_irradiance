# Challenges

1. Downloading data (chrome not loading zenodo, firefox did the trick)
2. Slow download speed
3. Lack of time due to flu

## questions

1. What are temporal deconstructions? I guess known covariate is the future and has some error?
2. Can I use predicted weather forecasts? they are usually good in 1 day forecasts
3. Any restrictions in the amount of data I can use? Can I look like a year in the past?
4. 

## advice
1. solar position + solar energy
2. filter out when sun is out, irradiance < 10
